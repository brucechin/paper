# Increment secret: An elementary page fault attack

Even before the official launch of Intel SGX, researchers showed the existence
of a [dangerous
side-channel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ctrlchannels-oakland-2015.pdf)
within the processor's virtual-to-physical address translation logic.  By
revoking access rights on selected enclave memory pages, and observing the
associated page fault patterns, adversaries controlling the operating system
can deterministically establish enclaved code and data accesses at a 4 KiB
granularity.  This attack technique has been proven highly practical and
effective, extracting full enclave secrets in a single run and without noise.

## Your task

Consider the following enclave function that increments a global variable `a`,
depending on some secret.

```C
void ecall_inc_secret(int s)
{
    if (s)
        a += 1;
}
```

**Do it yourself.** Edit the untrusted main function to reconstruct the secret
enclave input `s` based on the page fault pattern for the global variable `a`.
Some guidance notes:

* You can make use of the
    [mprotect](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html) library
    function to alter page-granular access rights.
* The provided skeleton program already takes care to redirect any page faults
    to the `fault_handler` function.
* Make sure to test both with an input `s=1` and `s=0` to make sure your attack
    proplerly handles both cases.

**Note.** For testing purposes, we pass the secret input `s` as plain text from
the main function, but in a real-world scenario the secret input would be
end-to-end encrypted so that only the enclave can see it.

### Defeating naive page fault access pattern defenses

Consider the following "hardened" version of the vulnerable increment function.
The idea is to hide the secret-dependent enclave page access, by always performing
a dummy access on the global variable `a` immediately after the secret branch.

```C
void ecall_inc_secret_maccess(int s)
{
    if (s)
        a += 1;

    /* DEFENSE IDEA: let's always access 'a', independent of the secret */
    volatile int b = a;
}
```

**Do it yourself.** Verify that your attack against `ecall_inc_secret` indeed
does _not_ anymore work against the hardened version above. Now, come up with a
way to refine your attack and distinguish the secret-dependent access from the
dummy access.

### Launching the attack on real SGX hardware

Now you have the proof-of-concept attack working in an _unprotected_
application on your own laptop, proceed to the `../002-sgx-inc-secret` program
to try and port your attack to a real Intel x86 SGX processor.
